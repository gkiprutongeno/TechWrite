# TechWrite
Technical writing.

### Syntax (Markdown Basics):

- **Headers** are created using `#` symbols. The number of `#` symbols denotes the header level (`#` for H1, `##` for H2, and so on).
  
- **Paragraphs** are written normally. Just hit Enter twice to create a new paragraph.

- **Lists** are created with `-` or `*` for bullet points, and `1.`, `2.` for numbered lists.

- **Code Blocks** are created with triple backticks (` `` ``) before and after the code block. You can also specify the language after the first set of backticks (` ```python ```).

- **Links** are created with `[text](url)`.
